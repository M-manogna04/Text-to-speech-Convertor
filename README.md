# Text-to-speech-Convertor

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. 
With a click of a button or the touch of a finger, TTS can take words on a computer or other digital device and convert them into audio.

# Downloading and Installing Modules
To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and gTTS library. To install the library we use pip install command on the command prompt

    " pip install tkinter"
    " pip install gTTS"
    
# gTTS
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI(command line interface) tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. Write spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout.
